# End-to-End LLM Project: News Research AI Tool and Q&A App

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a News Research Tool and Q&A App using Large Language Models (LLMs). The application integrates multiple technologies to help research analysts efficiently conduct their research and get answers to their questions. The core technologies used in this project include:

- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications with language models.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides access to powerful LLMs for generating and understanding text.
- **Faiss**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating interactive web applications for data science and machine learning.

## Features

- **News Retrieval**: Fetch and display relevant news articles based on user queries.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Utilize LLMs to provide summaries and insights into retrieved news articles.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Allows users to ask questions and get answers based on the context of the news articles.
- **Interactive Interface**: Use Streamlit to build an intuitive web interface for research analysts and users to interact with the tool.
